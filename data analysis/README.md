The more I look at how much non-council financial information is required to be posted, the more I think the intent
is for the feds to use this information to size up their opponent: Legal battle with a First Nation? Legal and political
strategy is determined by knowing how much infrastructure and resources they have; what connections (networks, social support)
they have to obtain additional funding for their legal battles, etc.

Like the NSA "it's just metadata" argument, you can determine a surprising amount with even this "meta" information
(and it's not even that meta).
